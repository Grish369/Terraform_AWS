VPC Configuration:

Establish a multi-VPC setup across two Availability Zones (AZs) to improve fault tolerance and reduce latency.
AZ 1: Containing VPC A and VPC B.
AZ 2: Containing VPC C.
VPC Peering:

Implement VPC peering connections between:
VPC A and VPC C
VPC A and VPC B
Restrict peering between VPC B and VPC C to maintain network isolation.
Subnet Design:

Each VPC must contain both public and private subnets to facilitate secure and efficient communication.
NAT Gateway Implementation:

Deploy a NAT Gateway in the public subnet of VPC C to allow instances in the private subnets of VPC A and VPC B to access the internet while keeping them secure.
S3 VPC Endpoint:

Configure a VPC Endpoint in VPC B for secure and efficient access to Amazon S3, ensuring that data transfer does not traverse the public internet.
Security Measures:

Implement security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to manage and monitor traffic flow between VPCs and subnets effectively.
Cost Optimization:

Design the architecture with scalability in mind, ensuring it is capable of handling increased loads during traffic spikes while also being cost-effective.
Traffic Management:

Ensure the architecture can dynamically scale to manage peak usage effectively, leveraging AWS services that support auto-scaling and load balancing.
